# Games For Love - Tech Code Repository
### Getting Started
Please look through GitHub's documentation for help on how to create/manage Git commits and pushes.  
Feel free to reach out Edison or any other 180DC member if you ever run into any unexpected errors with Git!  

**Always make sure to pull before making any changes, in case another analyst has committed new changes.**  

### Resources
Refer to the [Resources Document](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1TUYL9gFffJLFfMNC2tfJ-rADJZikAS7cbNSftfyJbmE/edit) in the 180DC project folder for links and notes on specific APIs and services we will be using.  
All other resources will also be in this folder, including workstreams, meeting minutes, and the Statement of Work.

### Support
Programming may be very frustrating at times, so always remember that there are other members on the team who are more than willing to help. Please text, email, or call me if you would like a 1-on-1 session, whether it be for debugging, understanding specific technologies, or general help!
